To obtain the code you should use git:

`git clone https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur.git`{{execute}}

Now you will find a directory called 'fleur' in which the code resides.

After cloning several branches(versions) of FLEUR are available:
* standard is the 'develop' branch which should contain the newest version. This sometimes does not run/complile but here all the bugfixes should appear first.
* the 'stable' branch will let you access the monthly snapshots.
* the 'release' branch will point to the last release.

You can choose the branch to use by typing for examle `git checkout stable`{{copy}}. This has to be done in the fleur directory.

If you are having trouble with git you can also download an archive containing the 'fleur' directory from https://iffgit.fz-juelich.de/fleur/fleur
