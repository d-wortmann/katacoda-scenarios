Finally it is time to compile FLEUR. Change into the 'build'-directory
`cd build`{{execute}}
and do a `make`{{execute}}.

This will take some time during which the various files are compiled.
At the end you will obtain two executables 'fleur' and 'inpgen'. If your system
also provides a MPI installation in addition you will see an executable 'fleur_MPI'.
